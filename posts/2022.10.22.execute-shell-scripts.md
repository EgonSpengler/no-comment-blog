## Running a script
Any file containing shell scripts can be run by invoking the **interpreter** directly:

```bash
egon@odin~$ bash script.sh
```

However, shell scripts are usually written with a "shebang" on the first line - the characters `#!` followed by the full path to the interpreter that should by used.
This allows the correct interpreter to be used automatically, e.g.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
  # this script should be run by sh, though this is usually
  # just a symlink to /bin/bash in modern systems
```
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python
  # lookup the path to the python interpreter for this script
```

This way, the script file can simply be marked as **executable** and run directly:

```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ chmod +x script.sh
/prompt/~/dir/ ./script.sh
```

## [>], [<], [>>] - Redirects
By default, each shell program you run inherits three **file descriptors** (which are actually IO streams accessible as files)
from the shell: stdin (0), stdout (1), and stderr (2). Any of these streams can be **redirected** to another file (or stream).

### [>] - Redirect and truncate
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ echo 5 > outfile.txt   # redirect stdout (normal program output) into a file.
                                    # If the file exists, it will first be truncated to zero
                                    # length (completely overwritten), else it will be created.
/prompt/~/dir/ echo 2 > outfile.txt
/prompt/~/dir/ cat outfile.txt
2
```

### [>>] - Redirect and append
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ echo 5 > outfile.txt
/prompt/~/dir/ echo 2 >> outfile.txt  # redirect stdout and create file if necessary.
                                    # Appends rather than overwrites as > does
/prompt/~/dir/ cat outfile.txt
5
2
```

### [<] - Redirect program input (stdin)
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ command < inputfile.txt
    # redirect stdin to read from a file rather than keyboard input
```

### Advanced redirection examples
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ command 2>&1
    # redirect stderr (2) to stdout (1) (i.e. print stderr to screen)

/prompt/~/dir/ command > /dev/null 2>&1
    # send stdout and stderr into the void (i.e. run 'command' silently)
```

## Variables
Bash variables can be set simply with `var=value` (and environment variables with `export VARIABLE=val`).

Prepend a $ to read from a variable.
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ num=4     # set variable (for this terminal session only)
/prompt/~/dir/ echo $num
4

/prompt/~/dir/ export PATH=PATH:~/bin  # add personal scripts dir to the PATH env variable.
/prompt/~/dir/ echo $?   # get return code of last command (POSIX standard is
0                      # 0 = success, anything else = error code)
```

## | - Pipes

### Normal pipes
In its simplest use case, the pipe redirects the **stdout** of the command before it to the **stdin** of the command after. For example:
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ ls -a | wc -l  # list all files in the current directory, pipe output
                            # to `wc` to count them  (wc -l => word-count --lines)

/prompt/~/dir/ find -type f -name '*.sql' | xargs rm  
                        # find all files matching *.sql, then bulk delete with xargs
```

### Named pipes
You can also create **named pipes** for communication across processes not running as a one-line command.

Open two separate terminal windows and try the following experiment:
<div className="overflow-x-scroll">
<table className="table-auto">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Terminal 1</th>
  <th>Terminal 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>

```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ mkfifo pipe1
      # Create a named pipe file at ~/pipe1
/prompt/~/dir/ echo "text" > pipe1
      # This will block - the write does not
      # "complete" until all these bytes are
      # read. Head over to terminal 2 now ->

/prompt/~/dir/ /cursor

```

  </td>
  <td>

```bash





/prompt/~/dir/ cat pipe1
text
/prompt/~/dir/ /cursor
    # Notice that 'echo' has now returned in term 1
```

  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
