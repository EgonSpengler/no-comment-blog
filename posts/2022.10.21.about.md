## Rationale

Some years ago, I was the primary maintainer of a Linux Tips and Best Practices
wiki page for my coworkers.  This blog is my effort to transcribe the contents
of that wiki page -- and expand upon them -- with discrete pages and topic tags to
aid in information lookup.

## Philosophy

This is not a Linux Software blog, nor is it a place to get news.  The primary
focus will be on Linux (the kernel) and GNU/Linux the OS, its features, and
usage examples.  "Blog" is even a bit of a misnomer, as I intend to write it as
more of a reference manual than editorial content.

I'll do my best to make no assumptions about the knowledge level of the reader,
and always start with the basics; while most of the topics are geared toward
helping beginners learn the most important fundamentals, I hope they will be
thorough enough for even Linux veterans to learn a thing or two.
