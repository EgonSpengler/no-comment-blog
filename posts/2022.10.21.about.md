## Rationale

A few years ago, I maintained a Linux tips wiki page for my coworkers.  This blog
is my effort to transcribe the contents of that wiki page, and expand upon them,
with discrete pages and topic tags to aid in information lookup.

## Philosophy

This is not a Linux Software blog, nor is it a place to get news.  The primary
focus will be on Linux (the kernel) and GNU/Linux the OS, its features, and
usage examples.  "Blog" is even a bit of a misnomer, as I intend to write it as
more of a reference manual than editorial content.

I'll do my best to make no assumptions about the knowledge level of the reader,
and always start with the basics; while most of the topics are geared toward
helping beginners learn the most important fundamentals, I hope they will be
thorough enough for even Linux veterans to learn a thing or two.
