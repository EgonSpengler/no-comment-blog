## Basic Usage

### Getting around in a Terminal
Just like the file explorer, your interactive shell is always "in" a directory.
The overwhelming majority of the actions you'll take in a terminal are likely
to be related to navigating this folder structure (by moving into and out of
directories) and interacting with the files they contain.

#### Navigation - cd / pwd / ls
When you first open your terminal emulator of choice, you'll be greeted by the interactive
shell (most likely this is `bash`) which shows a short prompt and a cursor, like so:

```bash
  /prompt/~/dir/ /cursor
# ^    ^    ^
# 1    2    3
```
  1. Username\
   This is the user you are authenticated as, and you can operate on files that this 
   user has permissions for.
  2. Hostname\
   The publicly-visible name you gave the computer, usually at install time.
  3. Working directory\
   The `~` in the prompt above is a shorthand for the home directory, in my case /home/egon.
   If you're ever unsure where you are (perhaps the directory name is so long it's cut off
   by the screen), `pwd` (**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory) will show the full path.
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ pwd
/home/egon
```

#### Changing Directories and Listing Contents

Use `ls` to **l**i**s**t the contents of the working directory. This is comparable to `dir`
if you're from a Windows background.
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Videos
Documents  Music      Public    test.txt
```
<div class="text-center">

</div>

Let's enter one of these directories with `cd` (**c**hange **d**irectory):
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ cd Documents
/prompt/~/Documents/dir/ 
  # The working directory is now /home/egon/Documents, and I can access the files it contains.
/prompt/~/Documents/dir/ ls
testdir  test1.txt  test2.txt  test5.txt  3sir.txt  test3.exe

  # Common flags to ls:
  #  -a (all) : include hidden (dot) files
  #  -d (dir) : list directory itself, not its contents
  #  -h (human-readable) : friendly sizes like 234M instead of 245366784
  #  -F (classify) : append type indicator (one of \*/=>@|) to entries
  #  -l (long) : long listing format (includes owner/group, permissions, date, size)
  #  -t (time) : order by time last modified
  #  --color=auto : highlight names according to type and state (dir,file,link,pipe,executable, etc.)
/prompt/~/Documents/dir/ ls -Flahtr --color=auto
total 12K
drwxr-xr-x 13 egon egon 4.0K Oct 25 06:48 /blu/../end//
-rw-r--r--  1 egon egon    0 Oct 25 06:50 test1.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 egon egon    0 Oct 25 06:50 test2.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 egon egon    0 Oct 25 06:50 test5.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 egon egon    0 Oct 25 06:50 3sir.txt
-rwxr-xr-x  1 egon egon    0 Oct 25 06:50 /grn/test3.exe/end/*
drwxr-xr-x  2 egon egon 4.0K Oct 25 06:51 /blu/testdir/end//
drwxr-xr-x  3 egon egon 4.0K Oct 25 07:00 /blu/./end//
```
`.` and `..` are virtual directories presented by the kernel as useful shortcuts.  `.` links to the
current directory and `..` links to the parent, so it is easy to back out of a folder or refernce a
file by its relative path to you.
```bash
/prompt/~/Documents/dir/ ls ..
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Videos
Documents  Music      Public    test.txt
/prompt/~/Documents/dir/ cd ..
/prompt/~/dir/ /cursor
```

#### Delete a file or folder
The command `rm` (**r**e**m**ove) is used to delete files (technically it removes a hardlink
to the file, but there will virtually always be just one, barring special circumstances).

**WARNING** - This doesn't send the file to trash like a file browser will.  It's GONE.

```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ ls
file1  file2
/prompt/~/dir/ rm file2
/prompt/~/dir/ ls
file1

  # Common flags:
  #  -r : recursively delete a directory and its contents
  #  -f : force, never prompt
/prompt/~/dir/ ls test-folder
test-file
/prompt/~/dir/ rm -rf test-folder
```

#### Copy a file
Use cp to copy a file or folder from one location to another (optionally renaming it as well).
```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ cp /etc/i3/config ./.config/i3/config  # copy and rename

/prompt/~/dir/ cp NewFont.ttf ~/.local/share/fonts/   # copy to dir without renaming
```

#### Move or rename a file
Use `mv` to move a hard link of a file (effectively cut-and-paste, and within the same filesystem
this should be nearly instantaneous). This is also the method used to rename a file.

**WARNING** - this will overwrite the destination file if it exists!

```bash
/prompt/~/dir/ mv Downloads/NewBashrc.txt ~/.bashrc
                  # replace .bashrc with a new file

/prompt/~/dir/ mv SpeldRong.txt SpelledRight.txt
                  # rename a file in place
```
